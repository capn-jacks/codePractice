#Asking the User to enter a prompt
orginal_prompt = input("I have a degrading kink. yell at me in all caps. ANtyhing you want. My safe word is trent williams  ")

#Converting the input into lower case

#printing input in lowercase 
print("trent williams. you dont have to be so mean. you could have jsut siad it like " + lower_case)
